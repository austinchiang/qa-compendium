======================
Liferay QA Github User
======================

The `Liferay QA Github user account`_ was created for the following reasons:

* Central repo for incoming pull requests for new tests and test fixes;
* Eases the PR review burden from a single reviewer; and,
* Allows for a wider pool of reviewers since the QA Test leads will be notified when a PR is submitted to the this user.

The repository will be kept up to date and synced with master using `OriginAI`_.

For more information, please `contact QA on Slack`_.
