Global QA Sync Guidelines
=========================

Objective
---------

In an effort to have more focused sync-ups and in the interest of everyone’s time we should focus our updates that improve collaboration between teams. We’re not trying to represent the amount of work we’re doing in these updates. This document will aim to provide some examples of updates to share and what updates not to share.

We also want to keep each update around 3 minutes each. Make a quick point and call out to others to reach out after the meeting, meet at another time, or online to discuss further.

Expectations
------------

#. Show up on time

#. Write you updates before the meeting

#. Points that you need to announce must be in bold

#. Hold each other accountable for sharing information that is helpful

#. Engage in the conversations that are brought up

#. Clearly communicate implications and expectations if it impacts other teams

#. Read the updates outside of the meeting

#. Organize meetings to follow up on points outside of the Global Sync

What to Share
-------------

Written updates and Spoken updates
==================================

To be efficient with our time, only verbally share the updates that you believe need to be raised and aware to the guild. Otherwise, keep the updates written. 

Generic updates relevant to all teams
=====================================
The meeting should start with important updates relevant to everyone on the call. For example, if there are process changes that are happening, communicate this at the beginning of the call so that people who can’t stay for the entire duration still get to hear the really important updates before dropping off. 

Team Milestones
===============

Sharing team milestones is helpful for fellow employees to know where things are going with the company at a high enough level to see the progress that they can relate with or inquire.

Examples:
  * Major product version releases
  * Major feature completion

Major Process Changes
=====================

Share major process changes to help inspire others to adopt improvements. These should be problems that you believe other members of the guild can face. 

Start by describing the problem to help build context then quickly describe the solution. Expect people who are interested to ask for more information after the sync up.

Help
====

This time can be used to reach out for help when the existing channels are not working. Don’t wait until this meeting to reach out for help.

Examples:
  * I have to do this thing in Poshi and I can’t figure it out. Can I get some help (afterward)?
  * I’m having a hard time with (a QA task), can someone help (afterward)?
  * I left some questions in my update, can you guys help answer them or point me in the right direction (afterward)?

High Risk
=========

Use this time to update the team on incoming high risk. As a listener, if you would like more information ask to meet to talk more after the sync up. If a new feature is coming in that you feel has a high risk in breaking stuff across many components you can use this time to make this announcement. However, it is encouraged to use the existing channels (Slack) to make announcements sooner than waiting for this weekly call.

Examples:
  * We’re merging a change that might break a lot of tests
  * A standard operating procedure or process is not being followed or is causing problems

Important Lessons
=================

The portal sync is also a great time to share any lessons learned that can help the rest of the team.  Sometimes we can learn more from failures than we can from successes, so even sharing when things didn't go as planned can help others learn and grow.

Examples:
  * We tried a new testing approach that allowed us to catch issues earlier in development
  * We tried using a new tool or utility, but it didn’t make us more effective in the end
  * An audit of community tickets revealed we were not testing an area that customers really care about

What Not to Share
-----------------

Day-to-Day Tasks
================

Avoid providing updates that summarize the day-to-day tasks that we all are familiar with. Much of these are not actionable by the team and we want to encourage collaboration. Don’t share updates on what sprint you’re on or that you’re just closing bugs and doing test fixes again.

Instead, look for bigger news like celebrating big success or raising big concerns.

Examples (of what **NOT** to do):
  * We finally finished fixing all of our tests because of our migration to react.js
  * We did sprint planning this week
  * Our developers worked on features A, B, C this week
  * QA is testing features A, B, C this week

Examples (of what to do):
  * We have so many bugs and test fixes that we’re drowning because of the react.js that got merged

Meeting Etiquette
-----------------

Keep it Short
=============

The QA Sync is a large meeting. Introduce yourself (just your name should be enough) so that people know who is speaking. Try to keep updates no longer than 3 minutes. This limitation is intended to provide the following benefits:

  * Encourages presenters to stay focused on the most important things
  * Helps others stay engaged
  * Prevents the meeting from running over time

Introduce Yourself
==================

When starting your update, introduce yourself. When you’re done call the next person in line so it’s clear that you’re done.

Examples:
  * Hey, this is KC for Test Management…
  * That’s all for our team.. Analytics Cloud is next

Listen and Collaborate
======================

Come to the meeting prepared to listen and collaborate. Your team members are bringing topics to the meeting that they need your help with or that they believe can help you.  Please be respectful by minimizing distractions that would take your concentration out of the meeting. Feel free to ask questions or comment on the meeting document.

Continue Later
==============

When an update sparks a problem-solving discussion among the team, resolve to meet at a later time to continue the discussion. While the QA Sync is meant to promote collaboration, we want to avoid extended problem-solving sessions that may not be relevant to everyone. Find the people who are interested in the topic you are discussing and resolve to meet afterward.

Pass the Baton
==============

Pass it along to the next person that has a bold update or speak up if you know you’re next in line. It is better to have nothing to update than to prolong the meeting with topics that will not benefit you or the team.

.. Important::
  Ask yourself if your updates concern:
    * Team Milestones
    * Major Process Changes
    * Help
    * High Risk
    * Important Lessons

  If they do not, then it is acceptable to simply say, “No major updates this week, the team is continuing on [current major project]”

  Remember, this meeting is not a reflection of the amount of work you or your team is doing. It is a space to create collaboration and share actionable knowledge.
